Our app is a comprehensive online medicine booking and delivery platform designed to cater to the medical domain. We have diligently crafted this application from the ground up, starting with Figma UI designs, which were later transformed into high-quality XML and Java code. Our main focus is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly frontend experience.

Within the app, users will find various UI screens, including a Home screen, Prescription Notification settings, and more, all tailored to enhance their overall experience. The platform draws inspiration from successful E-commerce giants like Amazon and Flipkart, ensuring a seamless and familiar shopping experience for our users.

One of the key features of our app is its integration with the Google Maps API. This enables users to enjoy hassle-free geolocation services, facilitating quick and efficient delivery of medicines to their doorstep.

For medication verification, we have implemented a cutting-edge AI system. Users can upload their prescription papers, and our AI will cross-reference them with the available medicines in the app. The result will display which medicines are readily available, streamlining the ordering process.

To facilitate smooth communication with external servers and APIs, we have employed Retrofit client API. By utilizing this technology, we ensure that our app has real-time access to the latest medical information, directly from the server.

For secure and seamless transactions, we have integrated the RAZORPAYMENT gateway. This allows users to purchase their required medicines with confidence, knowing their transactions are well protected.

Furthermore, our app employs a robust database saver API. Whenever a user purchases medicine or enters any information such as their address and name, the data is immediately saved in the SQL Lite server. This database stores vital details, including product names, product IDs, user addresses, user names, and more, providing essential insights and streamlining operations.

Our tech stack comprises Material UI Theme for XML and Java, SQL Lite for data storage, PHP for server-side scripting, and JSON for data exchange, ensuring a seamless and cohesive experience for our users.

In summary, our app is a one-stop solution for all medical needs. With its user-friendly interface, advanced AI prescription verification, reliable geolocation services, and secure payment gateway, we aim to redefine the online medicine booking and delivery experience.
